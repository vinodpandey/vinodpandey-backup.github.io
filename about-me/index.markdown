## About Me

I'm Vinod Pandey. I live in Delhi, India.  I am a computer programmer and consider myself a technology enthusiast. 

My first programming language was BASIC and GOTO seemed to be the solution to every problem. 
> That GOTO statement really tied the program together

I never really programmed that much in BASIC and was too innocent to really figure out the evil side of my best friend GOTO. Eventually, I moved to C and then Java. I discovered Python and fell in love with its simplicity and clarity.  


I have experience in designing and developing enterprise content managment, output management and web content management solutions. In my free time, I play with python and django.

In this blog, I will be writing about computers, mathematics and electronics.

Live long and prosper.
