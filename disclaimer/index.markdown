##Disclaimer

This is my personal blog. The views or opinions expressed here are mine alone and not those of my employer.

Any views/opinions expressed here should be taken with a pinch of salt.

> Experts are, if anything, more suspect than the amateurs, because they're less honest. You should question everything I write here, in the same way you question everything you’ve ever read online — or anywhere else for that matter. Your own research and data should trump any claims you read from anyone, no matter how much of an authority or expert you, I, Google, or the general community at large may believe them to be.
